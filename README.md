# AWS CodePipeline Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using AWS services and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. It showcases the use of AWS CloudFormation to set up a complete backend architecture including CodePipeline, CodeCommit, CodeDeploy, and CodeBuild.

## Benefits

- **Automation**: The entire infrastructure is set up automatically, reducing manual errors and saving time.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that the same environment is created every time, across different stages or regions.
- **Version Control**: The infrastructure can be version-controlled along with the application code.
- **Scalability**: Easy to replicate or scale the infrastructure as needed.

## Project Files

- `aws_codepipeline_template.yaml`: The main CloudFormation template that defines the entire infrastructure.
- `appspec.yml`: The application specification file used by AWS CodeDeploy to manage application deployments.
- `acctests-buildspec.yml`: The build specification file for acceptance tests in CodeBuild.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the web application.
- `scripts/`:
  - `install_dependencies`: Script to install necessary dependencies before deployment.
  - `start_server`: Script to start the application server after deployment.
  - `stop_server`: Script to stop the running application before new deployment.

## Implementation

### Setting up the Backend with CloudFormation

1. Download the CloudFormation template: `aws_codepipeline_template.yaml`

2. Navigate to the AWS Management Console and search for CloudFormation.

3. In the CloudFormation console, choose "Create stack" and select "With new resources (standard)".

4. On the "Specify template" page, choose "Upload a template file" and select the `aws_codepipeline_template.yaml` file.

5. Click "Next" and provide the following details:

   - Stack name: `aws-codepipeline`
   - Parameters > CodePipelineName: `aws-codepipeline`

6. Proceed through the next steps, acknowledging that CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names.

7. Create the stack and wait for the process to complete.

### Resources Created

The CloudFormation template creates the following resources:

- CodeDeploy application (CodePipeBlogSampleApplication)
- Deployment group (MyDemoDeploymentGroup)
- CodeCommit repository (NewsletterRepo)
- CodePipeline pipeline (final-pipeline)
- S3 bucket for pipeline artifacts
- EC2 instance (CodePipelineBlog)
- CodeBuild project (NewsletterBuild)

## Usage

Once the CloudFormation stack is created, you can start using the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Clone the CodeCommit repository created by the stack.
2. Make changes to your application code.
3. Commit and push your changes to the CodeCommit repository.
4. The pipeline will automatically detect the changes and start the build and deployment process.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of Infrastructure as Code in setting up a complete CI/CD pipeline using AWS services. It showcases how complex architectures can be defined, version-controlled, and easily replicated using CloudFormation. This approach not only saves time but also ensures consistency and reliability in the deployment process.
